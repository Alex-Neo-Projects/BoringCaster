# BoringCaster

A farcaster client intentionally made to be *boring*. 

### Why?

I am frustrated by the idea that twitter is so addicting that I can't control my attention. 

And as they say, "the most effective form of complaint is action", so here's my attempt at taking the internet back and putting myself in control in a very small way.

### Features

What you can do: 
   - Write casts 
   - View your own casts 

What it doesn’t have:
   - No likes 
   - No feeds
   - No viewing other people’s casts

Like one comment said: "This sounds more like narcicaster where one gazes into the pond at themself" which is also pretty true. 

Open to suggestions on how to keep it boring while making it less narcisstic!

### Requests for contribution (PRs)

The codebase is written in react native and likely to stay small, but there are some things I do want to add. If you can get to them before me, feel free!

  - I think replies are a valuable form of discussion. I like the idea of keeping them.
