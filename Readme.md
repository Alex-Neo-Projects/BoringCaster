# BoringCaster

A farcaster client intentionally made to be *boring*. 

### Why?

I'm frustrated by the idea that twitter is so addicting that I can't control my attention. 

And as they say, "the most effective form of complaint is action", so here's my attempt at taking the internet back and putting myself in control in a very small way.
